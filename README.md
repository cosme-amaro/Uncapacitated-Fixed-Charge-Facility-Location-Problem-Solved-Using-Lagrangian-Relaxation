# Uncapacitated Fixed Charge Facility Location Problem 
# Solved Using Lagrangian Relaxation

This project focuses on optimizing the location of facilities without capacity constraints, aiming to minimize fixed costs associated with facility setup and transportation costs. We consider the demand at each node and the distances between nodes to determine the optimal locations for facilities, ensuring efficient service delivery.

## Key Objectives:

* Minimize fixed costs associated with facility setup.
* Minimize transportation costs by strategically locating facilities.
* Determine the optimal number of facilities needed to meet demand requirements.
* Implement Lagrangian Relaxation to obtain efficient results in a reasonable time.

## Methodology
* Mathematical Modeling: Develop a mathematical model for the Uncapacitated Fixed Charge Facility Location problem, considering demand and distance factors.
* Solution: Utilize optimization algorithms to find the optimal solution that minimizes fixed and transportation costs. Low-Scale problems can be solved using IBM CPLEX.
* Large-Scale Problems: When a large number of nodes are added to the problem, the time taken to solve this problem grows exponentially. This is why it is proposed to use the Lagrangian Relaxation algorithm in order to solve the problem efficiently.

## Outcome:
The project outcome is to deliver a strategic plan for facility location that minimizes fixed costs and transportation costs, leading to cost savings and improved efficiency in service delivery. The plan will be valuable for decision-makers in various industries seeking to optimize their facility locations.

## Impact:
The optimized facility location plan has the potential to significantly reduce fixed costs associated with facility setup and transportation costs, improving the overall profitability and competitiveness of businesses. Additionally, it can enhance customer satisfaction by ensuring timely and cost-effective service provision.
